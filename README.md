# restaurant-review-stage-1

## Installation

You can clone this repository or download it as a .zip file.
Once downloaded, enter into the directory with the terminal and check your Phyton version using `python -V`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
For Phyton `2.x` use the command `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` to serve the page in a local host. For Phyton version `3.x` use the command `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `py -m http.server 8000`. In all the case Phython will use the port `8000`. Then go to `http://localhost:8000`with your favourite browser to view the website.

The requirement for pass the project was to make the app full responsive for the most common devices viewports (both style and images), make it accessibile (using proper semantic elements and ARIA-labels, alt attributes for any image and ARIA-roles) and cache in in a static site for offline use, using Cache API and ServiceWorker element.
